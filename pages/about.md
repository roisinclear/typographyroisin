Hello! This is Roisin Clear here, the creator of Clear Typography. I hope you are well. I created this space in order to be able to look at the importance and intricicies of typography in the media. I am going to look at why it's so influential for an impression one would like to create. 

I would like to talk about magazines and brands, but not only these. I am giving myself the scope to explore different genres and themes, where I see fit. There is so much to talk about with the typography and designs of things, that I feel I do not want to box myself in. 

I also chose to make my logo the way I did because I wanted to make it look friendly and accessible for all. I used blue and pink because I wanted it to appear universal. However, I also used a Serif font because I wanted it to also have a high-end tone - while still being for all.

A little background on me - am an aspiring journalist/presenter and I love to write. Which is why I like blogs. I also, separately have my own blog called Clear Content. I like to use 'clear' in my names because it also works as a pun on my name, while also making sense due to the content I produce - if you hadn't noticed hehe. Anyway, take a look at my other page as well if you want to/have time/can be bothered haha. Anyhow, enough about me, let's get writing and I hope you enjoy!
