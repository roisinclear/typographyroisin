<p> Hi! How are you? My name is Roisin Clear, I'm 20 years old, and I'm currently at University studying Media, Journalism and Publishing. I'm an aspiring journalist/presenter and am a disabled model. I'm also an avid user of social media (aren't we all!) and I love to write and love photography. 
  I've always been drawn to the creative subjects as I like the idea of putting my stamp on something, I also like that the creative subjects, such as writing or photography give you the scope to experiment and expand. Part of the reason I chose my university course is that we get to learn how to use lots of different creative mediums which will be valuable for my future career, anyway, enough, about me! Hope you enjoy! </p>

  <h3><u>My inspirations</u></h3>

  <div class="text2">


<p>A lot of my inspiration comes from Y2K (year two thousand). For example I like a lot of music from that era, and appreiciate artists who make music like that, as a kind of call back to the past. I also love 2000s style and would say that my own style is somewhat influenced by it. A lot of my photgraphy and editing that I've previously done has been heavily influenced by Y2K also.</p> 
</div>
<p>Here are some pictures of the 2000s style including Y2K bold, graphic makeup styles along with a picture of band Destiny's Child wearing typical clothing which was in style back then. I like to take inspiration from that and incorporate it into my own style.</p>

<p>Also, this is an example of my own photography and editing that was Y2K inspired. ☺ </p>

<p>In addition, the video above is from when I was raising money for Children In Need in 2020, and it also gives some information about me and my background. You also kind of get to meet my family! 
  Hope you enjoyed! ❤
</p>
<p>Finally, I am also grateful to say that I model on the side of studying for university. I'm very proud of this, and hold it close to my heart because I can see that society is making greaster room for difference as I am disabled and a model. I am part of the change I want to see - and hopefully I'll be able to keep aiding changing people's perception of beauty.</p>
